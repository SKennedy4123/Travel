            <h3>Corning, NY</h3>
            <p>
              Since its opening in 1951, The Corning Museum of Glass has
              inspired people to see glass in a new light. The Museum has grown
              exponentially over the years. Its history is a story of
              innovation, perseverance and immense community and corporate
              support. Today, the Museumâ€™s scholarship and outreach is felt
              around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Museum has grown into a collecting, exhibiting, teaching, and
              research facility. The Corning Museum of Glass is now home to the
              world's largest collection of glass, containing over 50,000
              objects representing 3,500 years of glass history. The Museum and
              Library actively acquire materials, curate special exhibitions and
              conduct extensive research. The renovated facilities annually
              welcome almost 460,000 visitors from around the globe.
